                I have set up my own Github account and live page using GitHub pages. I added my first index.html file to my repo and added two charts using the vegaembed function. The codes for these charts were provided in class.

    <h2>CC2. Building. Create your own visualisations</h2>
    <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
        I built two separate charts using the "create" tool. the first chart is on ethiopia inflation using data from Economics Observatory.  In the first chart, i formatted the appearance of the chart. In the second chart on vice spending, i downloaded the data from the EconomicsObservatory, organized it and saved it as a csv file then generated it as a json file and embedded it in my page.

        <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
            The total value of UK exports has been increasing over the years, but this increase has mainly been driven by strong growth in UK services exports.

    <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
        The growth in services exports exceeding imports is mostly seen in nominal terms. However, the annualised percentage growth shows that service exports only exceeded goods exports in 2022
